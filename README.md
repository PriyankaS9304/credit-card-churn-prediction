Credit Card Customer Churn Prediction

 Overview:

End-to-end Machine Learning project with an interactive Streamlit web interface.
Predicts whether a credit card customer will stay or churn based on demographics and transaction history.
Goes beyond basic ML notebooks — includes a working web app for real-time predictions.

 Key Highlights:

User-friendly UI with dropdowns for categorical features and numeric fields for customer data.
Business-relevant problem with real-world applications in banking, telecom, and subscription services.
Displays feature importance to understand which factors influence churn most.
Reusable model that can be adapted for multiple industries.
